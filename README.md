# status-reporter

I hate writing summary status reports for people higher up on the org chart than I. If I can automate this, #winning.

## Jira
Work status is tracked in Jira, use APIs to pluck out the data I care about

## Powerpoint
Take the data from Jira and produce a powerpoint summarizing current stat

## Email
Send out weekly summary emails to groups who have less to prioritize
